# Delivery Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze food delivery data from multiple platforms to uncover key insights for restaurant partners and consumers. The analysis is conducted using **Power BI** to visualize trends, customer preferences, and market dynamics in the food delivery industry.

## Team and Duration
- **Type:** Group Project  
- **Duration:** 1 Week  
- **Deadline:** 10/01/2025  

## Objectives
Enhance data engineering and analytical skills by:
- Working with **Power BI** for data visualization and analysis
- Exploring **geospatial data** to identify market trends
- Extracting and presenting insights from food delivery datasets
- Developing **data storytelling** and presentation skills

## Data
The provided data consists of three SQLite databases:
- **Uber Eats Database**  
- **Deliveroo Database**  
- **Takeaway Database**  

These databases contain structured information on restaurant listings, menu items, customer ratings, and delivery fees.

## Key Business Questions
This analysis focuses on answering:
1. What is the **price distribution** of menu items?
2. What is the **distribution of restaurants per location**?
3. Which are the **top 10 pizza restaurants by rating**?
4. Where are kapsalons offered, and what is their **average price**?
5. What is the **furthest point in Flanders from a bottle of Coke**, using geospatial data?
6. How do **restaurant distributions** compare across Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Takeaway? (Venn Diagram)
7. How do **delivery fees** vary across platforms and locations?
8. Which restaurants have the **best price-to-rating ratio**?
9. Where are the **delivery dead zones** (areas with minimal restaurant coverage)?
10. How does the availability of **vegetarian and vegan dishes** vary by area?
11. How do **ratings of similar restaurants** differ across platforms?
12. Identify the **top 3 hummus-serving restaurants** (World Hummus Order - WHO).
13. Two **original analyses** to be determined during the exploration phase.
